h1. RubyMotion Simple Dual Screen

This is a simple example/conversion of the Apple secondary screen paper in to RubyMotion

IMPORTANT NOTE: The simulator is great for testing how your secondary screen should look/work, however if you use the TV Out menu to adjust the secondary screen (connecting/disconnecting it while the app is running or even just changing the resolution) it will quit back to Springboard

It works by simply checking UIScreen.screens for more than one screen (one is built in to all the devices) and then listening to UIScreenDidConnectNotification/UIScreenDidDisconnectNotification to configure/remove the view on the secondary screen.
